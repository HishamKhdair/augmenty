FAQ:

- Many of these augmenters are completely useless for training?
That is true, many of these is rarely something you would train with. For instance randomly adding or removing spacing. However, augmentation can just as well be used to test whether a system is robust to certain variations.

- I wish to add an augmenter, how do I do it?
(link to auto PR)

- Can I use augmenty without using spacy?
(show utility function example)
